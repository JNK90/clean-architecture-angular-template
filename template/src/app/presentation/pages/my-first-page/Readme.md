# Page

Each page should have a module definition and a container component. Additionally it could have one or more components encapsulating different ui elements. The logic in this components should only be for persentational behaviour. The logic for data calls, services etc. should be encapsulated in the container. For datatransmission use angulars databinding, input and output.
